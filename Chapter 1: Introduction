## Chapter 1: Introduction

### Monte Carlo
The term **Monte Carlo** was motivated by the similarity of the computer-generated results to the action of the gambling devices used at the casinos in the city of Monte Carlo in the principality of Monaco. 
The term caught on and is now widely used in finance, science, and engineering.

### Example

π = SP(1 − V) − F

- π: Profit
- S: sales, follow the Poisson distribution with mean 10
- P: price, is lognormally distributed with mean $50 and standard deviation $10
- V: variable cost percentage, has the beta distribution with parameters minimum = 0%, maximum = 100%, alpha = 2, and beta = 3
- F: fixed cost, is $100
